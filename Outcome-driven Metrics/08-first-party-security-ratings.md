### 08. **First-Party Security Ratings**

#### **a. What is your organisation's current security rating, and how is it calculated?**
- **Metric**: Current security rating score.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Security rating = Calculated based on the organisation's security posture, typically using a standardised scoring system from a third-party provider
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Provides a benchmark of the organisation's overall security health, which can be compared over time or against industry peers.

#### **b. How has your security rating changed over time, and what factors have contributed to these changes?**
- **Metric**: Percentage change in security rating over a defined period.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Security rating change percentage = 
    ((Current security rating - Previous security rating) / Previous security rating) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Understanding the factors contributing to these changes can help identify areas of improvement or concern in the organisation's security practices.

#### **c. What security controls and practices are evaluated as part of the security rating assessment?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of evaluated security controls and practices that meet the required standards.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Compliance rate = 
    (Number of compliant controls/practices / Total number of evaluated controls/practices) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher compliance rate indicates strong adherence to security standards, which positively impacts the organisation's security rating.

#### **d. How does your organisation compare to industry benchmarks and best practices in terms of security rating?**
- **Metric**: Comparative score against industry benchmarks.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Benchmark comparison score = 
    (Organisation's security rating / Industry average security rating) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A score above 100% indicates that the organisation is performing better than the industry average, while a score below 100% suggests room for improvement.

#### **e. How is the security rating used to identify areas of weakness and prioritise security investments?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of security investments prioritised based on security rating findings.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Investment prioritisation rate = 
    (Number of prioritised investments based on rating findings / Total number of security investments) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher rate demonstrates that the security rating is effectively guiding investment decisions to address identified weaknesses.

#### **f. What communication channels are used to share the security rating with stakeholders, and how is this information used to build trust with customers and partners?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of security rating communications to stakeholders.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Communication frequency = Number of communications sent to stakeholders per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular communication of the security rating helps build and maintain trust with stakeholders by demonstrating transparency and commitment to security.

#### **g. What actions are taken to maintain or improve the security rating over time, and how are these actions tracked and evaluated?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of planned actions successfully implemented to maintain/improve the security rating.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Action implementation success rate = 
    (Number of successfully implemented actions / Total number of planned actions) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher success rate indicates proactive management of the organisation's security posture, leading to sustained or improved security ratings.
