### 12. **Company vs. Peer Performance**

#### **a. What key performance indicators are used to measure your organisation's security posture compared to industry peers?**
- **Metric**: Percentage comparison of key performance indicators (KPIs) with industry peers.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    KPI comparison rate = 
    (Organisation's KPI score / Industry average KPI score) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A score above 100% indicates that the organisation is performing better than industry peers, while a score below 100% suggests areas for improvement.

#### **b. What specific security controls and policies do peer organisations have in place that your organisation does not?**
- **Metric**: Gap analysis score for missing security controls and policies.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Gap analysis score = 
    (Number of missing controls/policies identified / Total number of controls/policies reviewed) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A lower score indicates fewer gaps in security controls and policies compared to peers, highlighting a stronger security posture.

#### **c. How is your organisation using benchmarking data to identify areas for improvement in your security program?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of identified areas for improvement addressed through benchmarking.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Improvement implementation rate = 
    (Number of improvements implemented based on benchmarking / Total number of identified improvements) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher implementation rate suggests that the organisation is effectively using benchmarking data to enhance its security program.

#### **d. What strategies are your peers using to stay ahead of emerging threats, and how can your organisation adopt those strategies to better protect against cyber attacks?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of peer strategies adopted by your organisation.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Strategy adoption rate = 
    (Number of peer strategies adopted / Total number of peer strategies identified) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher adoption rate indicates that the organisation is proactive in adopting effective strategies used by peers to counter emerging threats.

#### **e. How has your organisation's security performance compared to your peers over time, and what trends or patterns have emerged?**
- **Metric**: Trend analysis of security performance compared to peers over time.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Performance trend score = 
    (Organisation's performance improvement over time / Peers' performance improvement over time) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A score above 100% indicates that the organisation's security performance is improving faster than peers, while a score below 100% suggests the need for enhanced efforts.

#### **f. How is your organisation using competitive intelligence and industry insights to inform your security strategy and decision-making?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of security decisions influenced by competitive intelligence and industry insights.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Intelligence-driven decision rate = 
    (Number of decisions influenced by intelligence/insights / Total number of security decisions) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher percentage indicates that the organisation is effectively leveraging competitive intelligence and industry insights to strengthen its security strategy.
