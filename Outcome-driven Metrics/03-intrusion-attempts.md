### 03. **Intrusion Attempts**

#### **a. How many intrusion attempts have been detected and blocked by your intrusion detection system?**
- **Metric**: Number of intrusion attempts detected and blocked.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Total intrusion attempts blocked = Count of all detected and blocked attempts by IDS
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Tracking this number over time helps assess the effectiveness of the intrusion detection system and the threat landscape.

#### **b. What is the average time it takes to investigate and respond to detected intrusion attempts?**
- **Metric**: Average time to investigate and respond to intrusion attempts.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average response time = 
    Total time to investigate/respond to all intrusion attempts / Number of intrusion attempts
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A lower average response time indicates a more efficient incident response process.

#### **c. What is the process for reporting intrusion attempts to relevant stakeholders, including management, legal, and law enforcement?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of intrusion attempts reported within the required timeframe.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Reporting compliance rate = 
    (Number of intrusion attempts reported on time / Total number of intrusion attempts requiring reporting) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher compliance rate ensures that the organisation meets its legal and regulatory obligations.

#### **d. How many unauthorised access attempts have been detected and blocked by your firewall?**
- **Metric**: Number of unauthorised access attempts detected and blocked by the firewall.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Unauthorised access attempts blocked = Count of all unauthorised access attempts detected and blocked by the firewall
    ```
  - **Outcome**: This metric provides insight into the firewall's effectiveness and the frequency of attempted breaches.

#### **e. What is the process for investigating and responding to detected intrusion attempts, and how are those findings communicated?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of intrusion attempts fully investigated and reported.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Investigation and reporting rate = 
    (Number of fully investigated and reported attempts / Total number of detected intrusion attempts) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher rate indicates a thorough and transparent process for handling intrusion attempts.

#### **f. How are logs and other security event data collected and analysed, and what tools and processes are used for this purpose?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of security events logged and analysed.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Logging and analysis rate = 
    (Number of logged and analysed events / Total number of security events) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher percentage suggests robust logging and monitoring practices.

#### **g. How are security incidents classified and prioritised, and what response procedures are in place for each classification?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of security incidents correctly classified and prioritised.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Incident classification accuracy rate = 
    (Number of correctly classified incidents / Total number of incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher accuracy rate ensures that incidents are addressed according to their severity.

#### **h. How frequently are security logs reviewed, and what is the process for reviewing them?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of security log reviews.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Log review frequency = Number of log reviews conducted per day/week/month
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular log reviews help in the early detection of potential security issues.

#### **i. How are security events and incidents correlated and analysed to identify potential threats and attacks?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of correlated security events leading to threat identification.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Correlation success rate = 
    (Number of correlated events resulting in threat identification / Total number of correlated events) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher success rate indicates effective use of event correlation to detect threats.

#### **j. What measures are in place to prevent false positives and false negatives in intrusion detection systems?**
- **Metric**: Rate of false positives and false negatives in IDS.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    False positive rate = 
    (Number of false positives / Total number of detected intrusion attempts) * 100
    ```
    ```markdown
    False negative rate = 
    (Number of false negatives / Total number of actual intrusion attempts) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Lower rates indicate more accurate detection by the IDS, improving overall security effectiveness.

#### **k. How are network traffic patterns and anomalies monitored to detect potential intrusions?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of traffic anomalies detected and investigated.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Anomaly detection rate = 
    (Number of detected anomalies / Total network traffic) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher detection rate helps in identifying potential intrusions more effectively.

#### **l. How are incident response plans updated and tested in response to new intrusion attempts and attack trends?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of incident response plan updates and tests.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Incident response update frequency = Number of updates and tests conducted per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Frequent updates and tests ensure that incident response plans remain effective against emerging threats.

#### **m. How are security controls adjusted and fine-tuned based on the results of intrusion detection and response efforts?**
- **Metric**: Number of adjustments made to security controls based on IDS/response outcomes.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Control adjustment count = Count of adjustments made to security controls following IDS/response analysis
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular adjustments based on real-world data improve the overall effectiveness of security controls.
