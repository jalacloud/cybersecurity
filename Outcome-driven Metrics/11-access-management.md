### 11. **Access Management**

#### **a. How is access to sensitive data and systems controlled and monitored, and how is privilege escalation prevented?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of sensitive data and systems with controlled and monitored access.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Access control compliance rate = 
    (Number of sensitive data/systems with controlled access / Total number of sensitive data/systems) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher compliance rate indicates effective management and monitoring of access to critical resources, reducing the risk of unauthorised access or privilege escalation.

#### **b. What are the different types of user roles and access levels, and how are they defined and documented?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of user roles and access levels defined and documented.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Role documentation rate = 
    (Number of roles/access levels documented / Total number of roles/access levels) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Comprehensive documentation of roles and access levels ensures clarity in access management and helps prevent privilege mismanagement.

#### **c. How often are user accounts reviewed and audited for compliance with access policies and procedures?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of user account reviews and audits.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Review/audit frequency = Number of reviews/audits conducted per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular reviews and audits ensure ongoing compliance with access policies, reducing the risk of unauthorised access.

#### **d. Are all accounts secured with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of accounts secured with MFA.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    MFA adoption rate = 
    (Number of accounts with MFA enabled / Total number of accounts) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher MFA adoption rate enhances the security of user accounts, reducing the likelihood of credential-based attacks.

#### **e. Have you created password policies addressing common malpractices, such as password recycling and weak passwords?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of accounts compliant with password policies.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Password policy compliance rate = 
    (Number of accounts compliant with policies / Total number of accounts) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: High compliance with password policies ensures stronger authentication practices, reducing the risk of account compromise.

#### **f. What is the process for monitoring user activity and access logs, and how are suspicious or anomalous behaviours detected and investigated?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of user activity and access logs monitored for anomalies.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Log monitoring rate = 
    (Number of logs monitored for anomalies / Total number of logs) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher monitoring rate ensures that potential security threats are detected and investigated promptly.

#### **g. What controls are in place to protect privileged accounts?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of privileged accounts with enhanced security controls.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Privileged account security rate = 
    (Number of privileged accounts with enhanced controls / Total number of privileged accounts) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Effective controls for privileged accounts reduce the risk of critical security breaches through compromised accounts.

#### **h. What are the procedures for granting temporary or emergency access to users, and how are these situations documented and reviewed?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of temporary/emergency access requests documented and reviewed.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Temporary access compliance rate = 
    (Number of documented and reviewed requests / Total number of temporary/emergency access requests) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Proper documentation and review ensure that temporary access is granted and revoked appropriately, minimising security risks.

#### **i. How is access to third-party applications and services managed, and what additional controls are in place to prevent unauthorised access or data leakage?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of third-party applications/services with managed access controls.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Third-party access control rate = 
    (Number of third-party applications/services with controls / Total number of third-party applications/services) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Effective access management for third-party services reduces the risk of data leakage and unauthorised access through external channels.

#### **j. How are access policies and procedures communicated to users, and what training or awareness programs are in place to promote secure access practices?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of users trained on access policies and procedures.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    User training compliance rate = 
    (Number of trained users / Total number of users) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher training rate ensures that users are aware of and comply with access policies, promoting secure access practices across the organisation.

#### **k. How is access granted to new employees, and what is the process for removing access when an employee leaves the company?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of access provisioning and de-provisioning processes completed on time.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Provisioning/de-provisioning compliance rate = 
    (Number of processes completed on time / Total number of processes) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Timely management of access rights reduces the risk of unauthorised access by former employees or delays in granting necessary access to new employees.

#### **l. What is the process for managing access requests and approvals, and how are these requests documented and tracked?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of access requests documented and approved within the required timeframe.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Access request compliance rate = 
    (Number of documented and approved requests / Total number of access requests) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Ensuring timely and documented approvals enhances the transparency and security of access management.

#### **m. How is access control regularly audited and reviewed, and how often are access policies and procedures updated?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of access control audits and policy updates.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Audit/update frequency = Number of audits/updates conducted per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular audits and updates ensure that access controls remain effective and aligned with current security requirements.

#### **n. What are the consequences for non-compliance with access policies, and how is compliance with access policies monitored?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of non-compliant accounts with enforced consequences.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Consequence enforcement rate = 
    (Number of non-compliant accounts with enforced consequences / Total number of non-compliant accounts) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Enforcing consequences for non-compliance ensures that access policies are taken seriously and that deviations are corrected promptly.

#### **o. How is access to sensitive data and systems restricted, and how are those restrictions enforced?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of sensitive data/systems with enforced access restrictions.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Access restriction enforcement rate = 
    (Number of sensitive data/systems with enforced restrictions / Total number of sensitive data/systems) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Effective enforcement of access restrictions reduces the likelihood of data breaches and unauthorised access.

#### **p. How is the principle of least privilege applied to limit user access and reduce the risk of privilege escalation attacks?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of accounts adhering to the principle of least privilege.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Least privilege adherence rate = 
    (Number of accounts adhering to least privilege / Total number of accounts) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher adherence rate indicates that users have only the access necessary for their roles, reducing the risk of privilege escalation.

#### **q. What tools and processes are used to monitor user activity and detect potential insider threats?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of potential insider threats detected through user activity monitoring.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Insider threat detection rate = 
    (Number of detected insider threats / Total number of monitored users) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Effective monitoring tools and processes increase the likelihood of detecting and mitigating insider threats before they cause harm.
