### 1. **Level of Preparedness**

#### **a. How many devices on your corporate network have the latest security patches installed?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of devices with the latest security patches installed.
  - **Formula**: ```Percentage of patched devices = [ Number of devices with latest patches / Total number of devices ] x 100```
  - **Outcome**: Higher percentages indicate a higher level of preparedness and reduced risk of vulnerabilities being exploited.

#### **b. How many high-risk vulnerabilities have been identified?**
- **Metric**: Number of high-risk vulnerabilities identified.
  - **Formula**: Count of high-risk vulnerabilities from vulnerability scans.
  - **Outcome**: The metric should trend downwards as vulnerabilities are mitigated, indicating an improvement in security posture.

#### **c. How many systems have failed vulnerability scans, and what is the plan to remediate those issues?**
- **Metric 1**: Percentage of systems failing vulnerability scans.
  - **Formula**: ```Percentage of failed systems = [ Number of failed systems / Total systems scanned ] x 100```
- **Metric 2**: Average time to remediate failed systems.
  - **Formula**: ```Average remediation time = [ Total time to remediate all failed systems / Number of failed systems ]```
  - **Outcome**: A lower percentage of failures and reduced remediation time indicate better vulnerability management and faster recovery.

#### **d. How frequently are backups taken, and how are they tested for completeness and accuracy?**
- **Metric 1**: Frequency of backups.
  - **Formula**: Number of backups taken per week/month.
- **Metric 2**: Percentage of successful backup tests.
  - **Formula**: ```Percentage of successful tests} = [ Number of successful backup tests / Total backup tests conducted] x 100```
  - **Outcome**: Higher backup frequency and successful testing rates reflect better preparedness for data recovery.

#### **e. How often are disaster recovery, incident response, and business continuity plans tested, and when was the last successful test?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of DR/IR/BCP tests and time since last successful test.
  - **Formula**: Count of tests conducted per quarter/year and days since the last successful test.
  - **Outcome**: Regular testing and recent successful tests ensure plans are effective and up-to-date.

#### **f. How is your organization managing data classification and data retention policies, and how are those policies enforced?**
- **Metric**: Compliance rate with data classification and retention policies.
  - **Formula**: \( \text{Compliance rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of compliant instances}}{\text{Total instances reviewed}}\right) \times 100 \)
  - **Outcome**: Higher compliance rates indicate better management of data policies and lower risks related to data handling.

#### **g. What is the frequency of security awareness training for employees, and what metrics are used to measure its effectiveness?**
- **Metric 1**: Percentage of employees completing security awareness training.
  - **Formula**: \( \text{Completion rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of employees completing training}}{\text{Total employees}}\right) \times 100 \)
- **Metric 2**: Reduction in security incidents linked to human error post-training.
  - **Formula**: Comparison of incident count before and after training implementation.
  - **Outcome**: High completion rates and a reduction in incidents post-training indicate effective awareness programs.

#### **h. How are security policies and procedures updated and communicated to employees, and how is compliance monitored?**
- **Metric 1**: Frequency of security policy updates.
  - **Formula**: Number of updates made per quarter/year.
- **Metric 2**: Compliance rate with updated security policies.
  - **Formula**: \( \text{Compliance rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of compliant instances}}{\text{Total instances reviewed}}\right) \times 100 \)
  - **Outcome**: Frequent updates and high compliance rates reflect effective policy management and communication.

#### **i. How many devices on your corporate network are running outdated operating systems or software?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of devices running outdated OS/software.
  - **Formula**: \( \text{Percentage of outdated devices} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of outdated devices}}{\text{Total number of devices}}\right) \times 100 \)
  - **Outcome**: A lower percentage indicates better preparedness and reduced risk.

#### **j. How many devices on your network are running end-of-life (EOL) software no longer receiving security updates?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of devices running EOL software.
  - **Formula**: \( \text{Percentage of EOL devices} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of EOL devices}}{\text{Total number of devices}}\right) \times 100 \)
  - **Outcome**: Reducing this percentage over time improves security posture by minimizing unsupported software.

#### **k. How often are security risk assessments conducted, and what actions are taken as a result of those assessments?**
- **Metric 1**: Frequency of security risk assessments.
  - **Formula**: Number of assessments conducted per quarter/year.
- **Metric 2**: Percentage of identified risks mitigated post-assessment.
  - **Formula**: \( \text{Mitigation rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of risks mitigated}}{\text{Total risks identified}}\right) \times 100 \)
  - **Outcome**: Regular assessments and high mitigation rates demonstrate proactive risk management.

#### **l. How are security controls tested for effectiveness and assurance?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of controls passing effectiveness tests.
  - **Formula**: \( \text{Passing rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of controls passing tests}}{\text{Total controls tested}}\right) \times 100 \)
  - **Outcome**: A higher passing rate indicates effective security controls.

#### **m. How often are security policies and procedures reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the threat landscape?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of policy reviews and updates.
  - **Formula**: Number of reviews/updates per quarter/year.
  - **Outcome**: Frequent updates suggest adaptability to emerging threats, improving overall security.
