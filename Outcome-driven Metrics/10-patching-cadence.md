### 10. **Patching Cadence**

#### **a. How frequently are security patches and updates released by software vendors, and how quickly are they implemented?**
- **Metric 1**: Average frequency of security patch releases.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Patch release frequency = Number of patches released per month/quarter/year
    ```
- **Metric 2**: Average time to implement security patches.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Patch implementation time = 
    Total time to implement all patches / Number of patches implemented
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Frequent patch releases and quick implementation times indicate a proactive approach to mitigating vulnerabilities.

#### **b. How are high-risk vulnerabilities prioritised for patching, and what is the process for testing and validating patches before implementation?**
- **Metric 1**: Percentage of high-risk vulnerabilities patched within the required timeframe.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    High-risk patching rate = 
    (Number of high-risk vulnerabilities patched on time / Total number of high-risk vulnerabilities) * 100
    ```
- **Metric 2**: Percentage of patches successfully tested and validated before implementation.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Patch validation success rate = 
    (Number of successfully tested patches / Total number of patches) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: High patching and validation rates ensure that critical vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and effectively.

#### **c. How are legacy systems and software that are no longer supported by vendors patched, and what measures are in place to mitigate their security risks?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of legacy systems with mitigation measures in place.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Legacy system mitigation rate = 
    (Number of legacy systems with mitigations / Total number of legacy systems) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher mitigation rate indicates that the organisation is effectively managing the security risks associated with unsupported systems.

#### **d. How are patches and updates distributed and installed across different devices and systems, and how is this process managed and monitored?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of devices with successfully installed patches.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Patch installation success rate = 
    (Number of devices with installed patches / Total number of devices) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher success rate ensures that patches are being effectively distributed and installed, reducing the risk of unpatched vulnerabilities.

#### **e. What is the average time it takes to apply patches once they are released, and what is the maximum acceptable patching window for high-risk vulnerabilities?**
- **Metric 1**: Average patch application time.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average patch application time = 
    Total time to apply all patches / Number of patches applied
    ```
- **Metric 2**: Percentage of high-risk patches applied within the acceptable window.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    High-risk patch compliance rate = 
    (Number of high-risk patches applied within the window / Total number of high-risk patches) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Ensures that critical vulnerabilities are addressed within an acceptable timeframe to minimise security risks.

#### **f. What metrics are used to track patching effectiveness and compliance, and how are these metrics used to drive improvements in the patching process?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of systems compliant with patching policies.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Patching compliance rate = 
    (Number of systems compliant with patching policies / Total number of systems) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: High compliance rates indicate that the patching process is effective and that systems are regularly updated.

#### **g. How are patches validated to ensure they do not cause any conflicts or disruptions in the systems they are being applied to?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of patches validated without causing system conflicts or disruptions.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Conflict-free patch validation rate = 
    (Number of patches validated without conflicts / Total number of patches validated) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher rate suggests that the patching process is well-managed, with minimal disruption to system operations.

#### **h. How are legacy systems and applications that are no longer supported with security patches being handled? Is there a plan in place for dealing with these systems?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of legacy systems with a documented mitigation plan.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Legacy system planning rate = 
    (Number of legacy systems with mitigation plans / Total number of legacy systems) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher planning rate ensures that unsupported systems are managed proactively to mitigate associated security risks.

#### **i. Are there any exceptions to the patching process, such as certain systems or applications that cannot be patched for operational or other reasons? How are these exceptions managed and mitigated?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of systems with documented patching exceptions and mitigations.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Exception management rate = 
    (Number of systems with managed exceptions / Total number of systems with exceptions) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Proper management of exceptions ensures that even unpatched systems are protected through alternative security measures.
