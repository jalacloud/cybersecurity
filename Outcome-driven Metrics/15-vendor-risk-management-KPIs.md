### 15. **Vendor Risk Management KPIs**

#### **a. How many vendors have been assessed for risk?**
- **Metric**: Total number of vendors assessed for risk.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Total vendor risk assessments = Count of all vendors that have undergone risk assessments
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Provides a clear picture of how thoroughly the organisation is evaluating the risks associated with its vendors.

#### **b. What is the average risk score of your vendors?**
- **Metric**: Average risk score across all assessed vendors.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average vendor risk score = 
    Total risk score of all assessed vendors / Number of vendors assessed
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Helps in understanding the overall risk profile of the vendor ecosystem, which can guide risk mitigation strategies.

#### **c. How frequently are your vendors assessed for risk?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of vendor risk assessments.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Assessment frequency = Number of assessments conducted per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular assessments ensure that the organisation remains aware of any changes in vendor risk levels.

#### **d. What criteria are used to evaluate vendor risk, and how are these criteria applied consistently across all vendors?**
- **Metric**: Consistency rate in applying risk evaluation criteria.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Consistency application rate = 
    (Number of vendors evaluated with consistent criteria / Total number of vendors assessed) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A high consistency rate ensures that vendor risk is evaluated fairly and accurately across the board.

#### **e. What risk management strategies are in place to address high-risk vendors, and how are these strategies communicated to stakeholders?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of high-risk vendors with documented risk management strategies.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    High-risk management rate = 
    (Number of high-risk vendors with management strategies / Total number of high-risk vendors) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Ensures that high-risk vendors are being actively managed to mitigate potential threats, with clear communication to stakeholders.

#### **f. How are vendor risk assessments conducted, and what tools and processes are used to ensure consistency and accuracy?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of risk assessments conducted using standardised tools and processes.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Standardisation rate = 
    (Number of assessments conducted with standard tools/processes / Total number of assessments) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher standardisation rate ensures that vendor risk assessments are consistent, accurate, and reliable.

#### **g. How are vendor risk assessments prioritised based on criticality to business operations?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of critical vendors prioritised for risk assessments.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Critical vendor prioritisation rate = 
    (Number of critical vendors assessed / Total number of critical vendors) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Ensures that the most critical vendors are assessed first, addressing the most significant risks to the organisation.

#### **h. How are vendor risk assessments integrated into the overall risk management framework for the organisation?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of vendor risk assessments integrated into the organisational risk management framework.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Integration rate = 
    (Number of vendor assessments integrated / Total number of vendor assessments) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher integration rate ensures that vendor risks are considered in the broader context of the organisationâ€™s risk management strategy.

#### **i. How are vendors notified of the results of their risk assessment, and what follow-up actions are taken to remediate identified risks?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of vendors notified and engaged in follow-up actions.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Notification and follow-up rate = 
    (Number of vendors notified with follow-up actions / Total number of assessed vendors) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Ensures that vendors are aware of identified risks and are taking steps to mitigate them, improving overall security.

#### **j. How are vendor risk assessments updated and reviewed over time, and what triggers a re-assessment of vendor risk?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of vendor risk re-assessments.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Re-assessment frequency = Number of re-assessments conducted per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular re-assessments ensure that vendor risks are continually monitored and managed as circumstances change.

#### **k. What metrics are used to track the effectiveness of the vendor risk management program, and how are these metrics reported to stakeholders?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of risk management metrics meeting effectiveness benchmarks.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Effectiveness benchmark rate = 
    (Number of metrics meeting benchmarks / Total number of risk management metrics) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher rate indicates that the vendor risk management program is effectively reducing risks and improving security.

#### **l. How many of your vendors are subject to regulatory compliance requirements?**
- **Metric**: Total number of vendors subject to regulatory compliance.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Regulatory compliance count = Count of all vendors subject to regulatory requirements
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Understanding this number helps in prioritising compliance efforts and managing associated risks.

#### **m. How many of your vendors have undergone compliance assessments, and what were the results?**
- **Metric 1**: Number of vendors that have undergone compliance assessments.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Compliance assessment count = Count of all vendors that have undergone assessments
    ```
- **Metric 2**: Percentage of vendors that passed compliance assessments.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Compliance pass rate = 
    (Number of vendors passing assessments / Total number of assessed vendors) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher pass rate indicates strong vendor adherence to regulatory requirements, reducing compliance risks for the organisation.
