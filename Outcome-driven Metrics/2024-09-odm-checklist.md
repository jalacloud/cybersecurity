# Outcome-driven Metrics (ODMs)

Outcome-driven metrics have a direct relationship to operational outcomes of cybersecurity investment and to the level of protection delivered in a business context. 
Using ODMs, CIOs/CISOs can more effectively drive priorities and investments that balance the need to protect the business with the need to run it

To demonstrate how to improve performance across all fourteen (14) primary cybersecurity metrics, each checklist item is presented in question form.

## 1. Level of Preparedness 
- [ ] How many devices on your corporate network have the latest security patches installed?
- [ ] How many high-risk vulnerabilities have been identified?
- [ ] How many systems have failed vulnerability scans, and what is the plan to remediate those issues?
- [ ] How frequently are backups taken, and how are they tested for completeness and accuracy?
- [ ] How often are disaster recovery, incident response, and business continuity plans tested, and when was the last successful test?
- [ ] How is your organization managing data classification and data retention policies, and how are those policies enforced?
- [ ] What is the frequency of security awareness training for employees, and what metrics are used to measure its effectiveness?
- [ ] How are security policies and procedures updated and communicated to employees, and how is compliance monitored?
- [ ] How many devices on your corporate network are running outdated operating systems or software?
- [ ] How many devices on your network are running end-of-life (EOL) software no longer receiving security updates?
- [ ] How often are security risk assessments conducted, and what actions are taken as a result of those assessments?
- [ ] How are security controls tested for effectiveness and assurance?
- [ ] How often are security policies and procedures reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the threat landscape?
