# Outcome-driven Metrics (ODMs)

```"Outcome-driven metrics have a direct relationship to operational outcomes of cybersecurity investment and to the level of protection delivered in a business context. 
Using ODMs, CIOs/CISOs can more effectively drive priorities and investments that balance the need to protect the business with the need to run it." - Source: Gartner (December 2023)

To demonstrate how to improve performance across all fourteen (14) primary cybersecurity metrics, each checklist item is presented in question form.

## 01. Level of Preparedness 
- [ ] How many devices on your corporate network have the latest security patches installed?
- [ ] How many high-risk vulnerabilities have been identified?
- [ ] How many systems have failed vulnerability scans, and what is the plan to remediate those issues?
- [ ] How frequently are backups taken, and how are they tested for completeness and accuracy?
- [ ] How often are disaster recovery, incident response, and business continuity plans tested, and when was the last successful test?
- [ ] How is your organization managing data classification and data retention policies, and how are those policies enforced?
- [ ] What is the frequency of security awareness training for employees, and what metrics are used to measure its effectiveness?
- [ ] How are security policies and procedures updated and communicated to employees, and how is compliance monitored?
- [ ] How many devices on your corporate network are running outdated operating systems or software?
- [ ] How many devices on your network are running end-of-life (EOL) software no longer receiving security updates?
- [ ] How often are security risk assessments conducted, and what actions are taken as a result of those assessments?
- [ ] How are security controls tested for effectiveness and assurance?
- [ ] How often are security policies and procedures reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the threat landscape?

## 02. Unidentified Devices on Internal Networks
- [ ] What is the inventory of authorized devices on your network, and how is it maintained and kept up-to-date?
- [ ] How many assets are there in your network?
- [ ] How many of those assets store sensitive data?
- [ ] What is the process for responding to unauthorized devices on the network, and how are these devices quarantined and monitored?
- [ ] How are IoT devices secured, and what is the process for monitoring and patching their vulnerabilities?
- [ ] How is network segmentation implemented, and how are different types of devices segregated on the network?
- [ ] How are access controls implemented for devices on your network, and what is the process for granting and revoking access permissions?
- [ ] How are devices authenticated and authorized before being allowed toconnect to the network?
- [ ] What is the policy for employees bringing their own devices (BYOD) to work, and how are these devices managed and secured?
- [ ] What measures are in place to detect and respond to rogue access points or other unauthorized network infrastructure?
- [ ] What is the process for tracking the lifecycle of devices on your network, including acquisition, deployment, maintenance, and retirement?
- [ ] How are third-party devices and services securely integrated into your network, and what is the process for managing their access and permissions?
- [ ] What is the policy for remote access to your network, and what measures are in place to secure and monitor remote connections?
