### 05. **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**

#### **a. How long does it take for your team to become aware of security threats and incidents?**
- **Metric**: Average time to detect security threats and incidents.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average detection time = 
    Total time to detect all security threats/incidents / Number of detected threats/incidents
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A shorter detection time indicates a more responsive and effective threat monitoring system.

#### **b. What is the average MTTD for your organisation?**
- **Metric**: Organisation-wide Mean Time to Detect (MTTD).
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Organisation MTTD = 
    Total detection time for all incidents / Number of incidents
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Provides a benchmark for evaluating the overall efficiency of the organisation's detection capabilities.

#### **c. What is the process for detecting and responding to security threats and incidents, and how is this process tested and validated?**
- **Metric 1**: Detection process validation rate.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Detection process validation rate = 
    (Number of validated detection processes / Total number of detection processes) * 100
    ```
- **Metric 2**: Frequency of testing detection processes.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Detection process test frequency = Number of tests conducted per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: High validation rates and frequent testing ensure the reliability and effectiveness of detection and response processes.

#### **d. How are threat intelligence feeds and other sources of security information used to improve MTTD?**
- **Metric**: Percentage reduction in MTTD due to threat intelligence integration.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    MTTD reduction percentage = 
    ((MTTD before intelligence integration - MTTD after integration) / MTTD before intelligence integration) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A significant reduction in MTTD indicates that threat intelligence is effectively enhancing detection capabilities.

#### **e. How are security controls and monitoring tools tuned to improve detection and response times?**
- **Metric**: Percentage improvement in detection time after tuning controls/tools.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Detection time improvement rate = 
    ((Detection time before tuning - Detection time after tuning) / Detection time before tuning) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Positive improvement rates suggest that adjustments to controls and tools are successfully optimising detection and response times.

#### **f. How are alerts and events from security monitoring tools triaged and prioritised, and what criteria are used to determine severity?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of alerts correctly triaged and prioritised.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Triage accuracy rate = 
    (Number of correctly prioritised alerts / Total number of alerts) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A high accuracy rate ensures that critical threats are addressed promptly, improving overall security responsiveness.

#### **g. How often are security monitoring tools and sensors updated, and how is their updated performance monitored?**
- **Metric 1**: Frequency of updates for monitoring tools and sensors.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Tool/sensor update frequency = Number of updates conducted per quarter/year
    ```
- **Metric 2**: Percentage improvement in performance post-update.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Performance improvement rate = 
    ((Performance before update - Performance after update) / Performance before update) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular updates and performance improvements indicate that monitoring tools are being effectively maintained and optimised.

#### **h. What is the process for investigating and resolving security alerts and incidents, and how are those findings communicated?**
- **Metric**: Average time to investigate and communicate findings.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average investigation/communication time = 
    Total time to investigate and communicate findings / Number of alerts/incidents
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A shorter average time indicates an efficient investigation process and timely communication to relevant stakeholders.

#### **i. How are false positives and false negatives addressed in the security monitoring process, and how is this process continually refined?**
- **Metric**: Rate of false positives and false negatives.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    False positive rate = 
    (Number of false positives / Total number of detected threats/incidents) * 100
    ```
    ```markdown
    False negative rate = 
    (Number of false negatives / Total number of actual threats/incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Lower rates indicate more accurate monitoring, leading to improved security posture.

#### **j. How are security incidents classified and prioritised, and what response procedures are in place for each classification?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of incidents correctly classified and prioritised.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Incident classification accuracy rate = 
    (Number of correctly classified incidents / Total number of incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A high accuracy rate ensures that incidents are handled in accordance with their severity, optimising response effectiveness.

#### **k. What training and education programs are in place for security analysts and incident responders, and how is their performance monitored and evaluated?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of security analysts and responders meeting performance benchmarks.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Performance benchmark rate = 
    (Number of analysts/responders meeting benchmarks / Total number of analysts/responders) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A high benchmark rate reflects the effectiveness of training and the capability of the incident response team.

#### **l. How are key metrics and KPIs related to MTTD reported to stakeholders, and what actions are taken based on this information?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of MTTD KPI reporting and subsequent action plans.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Reporting and action frequency = Number of reports and action plans generated per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular reporting and actionable insights ensure continuous improvement in detection and response times.
