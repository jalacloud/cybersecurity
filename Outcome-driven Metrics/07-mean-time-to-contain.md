### 07. **Mean Time to Contain (MTTC)**

#### **a. How long does it take to contain identified attack vectors across all endpoints and systems from the time of initial detection?**
- **Metric**: Average time to contain attack vectors.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average containment time = 
    Total time to contain all attack vectors / Number of attack vectors
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A shorter containment time indicates a more effective and rapid response to threats.

#### **b. What is the average MTTC for each type of security incident or attack, such as malware infections, data breaches, and DDoS attacks?**
- **Metric**: Incident-type specific Mean Time to Contain (MTTC).
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    MTTC for incident type = 
    Total containment time for specific incident type / Number of incidents of that type
    ```
  - **Outcome**: This metric provides insight into the organisation's ability to contain different types of incidents effectively.

#### **c. How effective are your containment measures in preventing further damage or data loss, as measured by the scope and severity of each incident?**
- **Metric**: Percentage reduction in damage or data loss due to containment measures.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Damage/data loss reduction percentage = 
    ((Initial damage/data loss estimate - Final damage/data loss after containment) / Initial damage/data loss estimate) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher reduction percentage indicates that containment measures are effective in limiting the impact of incidents.

#### **d. How well do your incident response team and processes work in coordinating containment efforts across different departments such as IT, legal, and public relations?**
- **Metric**: Average coordination time for containment across departments.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Coordination time = 
    Total time for cross-department coordination / Number of incidents requiring coordination
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A lower coordination time suggests efficient teamwork and communication across departments, improving the containment process.

#### **e. How do you prioritise and allocate resources to different types of incidents based on their severity, impact, and risk to your business operations and reputation?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of incidents where resources were correctly prioritised and allocated.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Resource allocation accuracy rate = 
    (Number of incidents with correct resource allocation / Total number of incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher accuracy rate ensures that critical incidents receive the necessary resources, enhancing the containment effectiveness.

#### **f. How will you prevent similar incidents in the future across each of the following threat mitigation categories - security controls, awareness training, policy and procedure updates?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of incidents with implemented preventative measures across all categories.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Preventative measures implementation rate = 
    (Number of incidents with measures implemented across all categories / Total number of incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher implementation rate indicates a proactive approach to reducing the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future.

#### **g. How do you evaluate the success of your containment efforts, such as by measuring the reduction in incident frequency, cost, and time-to-remediation, as well as the improvement in security awareness and compliance?**
- **Metric**: Overall success rate of containment efforts.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Containment success rate = 
    (Combined score of reductions in frequency, cost, time-to-remediation, and improvement in awareness/compliance) / Total potential score * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher success rate reflects effective containment strategies and continuous improvement in security measures.

#### **h. How do you measure the reduction in incident frequency?**
- **Metric**: Percentage reduction in incident frequency post-containment.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Incident frequency reduction percentage = 
    ((Incident frequency before containment - Incident frequency after containment) / Incident frequency before containment) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A significant reduction percentage indicates successful containment and mitigation efforts.

#### **i. How do you measure the reduction in time-to-remediation?**
- **Metric**: Percentage reduction in time-to-remediation post-containment.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Time-to-remediation reduction percentage = 
    ((Time-to-remediation before containment - Time-to-remediation after containment) / Time-to-remediation before containment) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher reduction percentage shows that containment efforts have led to faster resolution of incidents.

#### **j. How do you measure improvement in the cybersecurity habits of your staff?**
- **Metric**: Percentage improvement in staff cybersecurity practices post-incident.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Improvement in cybersecurity habits = 
    (Score increase in staff cybersecurity practices assessments post-incident / Total possible score increase) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher improvement percentage indicates that incidents are being used as learning opportunities to strengthen overall security culture.
