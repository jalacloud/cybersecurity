### 09. **Average Vendor Security Ratings**

#### **a. How many vendors are in your organisation's supply chain, and what percentage of those vendors are considered high-risk?**
- **Metric 1**: Total number of vendors in the supply chain.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Total vendors = Count of all vendors in the supply chain
    ```
- **Metric 2**: Percentage of high-risk vendors.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    High-risk vendor percentage = 
    (Number of high-risk vendors / Total number of vendors) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Identifying the proportion of high-risk vendors helps in focusing security efforts where they are most needed.

#### **b. What criteria are used to evaluate vendor security, and how are those criteria weighted?**
- **Metric**: Weighted score for vendor security evaluation.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Vendor security score = 
    Sum of weighted scores based on predefined evaluation criteria (e.g., compliance, past incidents, security controls)
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher score indicates a vendor with a stronger security posture according to the organisation’s criteria.

#### **c. How frequently are vendor security assessments conducted, and what is the process for conducting those assessments?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of vendor security assessments.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Assessment frequency = Number of assessments conducted per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular assessments ensure that vendor security remains up-to-date and aligned with the organisation’s standards.

#### **d. What types of security ratings or scoring systems are used to evaluate vendor security, and how are those ratings incorporated into the vendor selection process?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of vendor selection decisions influenced by security ratings.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Security rating influence rate = 
    (Number of selections influenced by security ratings / Total number of vendor selections) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher influence rate indicates that security ratings are effectively integrated into the vendor selection process, enhancing the organisation’s overall security posture.

#### **e. How are vendor security ratings monitored and updated over time, and what is the process for re-evaluating vendor security when new vulnerabilities or threats emerge?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of updates to vendor security ratings.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Rating update frequency = Number of updates conducted per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular updates ensure that the vendor’s security ratings accurately reflect their current risk level and that emerging threats are appropriately addressed.

#### **f. What is the process for addressing vendor security issues, and how are those issues communicated to the vendor?**
- **Metric**: Average time to address and communicate vendor security issues.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Issue resolution time = 
    Total time to resolve and communicate all issues / Number of issues
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A shorter resolution time indicates effective communication and resolution processes, reducing the potential risk posed by vendor security issues.

#### **g. How is vendor security performance evaluated and reported to senior management or the board, and what metrics are used to measure vendor security performance?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of vendors meeting the organisation’s security performance benchmarks.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Vendor performance benchmark rate = 
    (Number of vendors meeting benchmarks / Total number of vendors) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher rate reflects a strong overall security performance across the vendor base, ensuring alignment with the organisation’s security requirements.
