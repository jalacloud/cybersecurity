### 06. **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**

#### **a. What is your mean response time following immediate awareness of a cyberattack?**
- **Metric**: Average response time following awareness of a cyberattack.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average response time = 
    Total time taken to respond after awareness / Number of cyberattacks
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A lower average response time indicates a more efficient initial response process.

#### **b. What is the average MTTR for your organisation?**
- **Metric**: Organisation-wide Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR).
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Organisation MTTR = 
    Total resolution time for all incidents / Number of incidents
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Provides a benchmark for evaluating the overall efficiency of the organisation's incident resolution capabilities.

#### **c. How is incident response coordinated and managed, and what resources and personnel are involved in the response process?**
- **Metric**: Average time for incident response coordination and management.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average coordination time = 
    Total time for incident coordination/management / Number of incidents
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A lower average time suggests effective coordination and resource management during incidents.

#### **d. How is the incident response process continually evaluated and improved, and what metrics are used to track this process?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of incident response process evaluations and improvements.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Process evaluation frequency = Number of evaluations and improvements conducted per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Frequent evaluations and improvements ensure the response process remains effective and up-to-date.

#### **e. How are security incidents categorised and prioritised, and what response procedures are in place for each category?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of incidents correctly categorised and prioritised.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Incident categorisation accuracy rate = 
    (Number of correctly categorised incidents / Total number of incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A high accuracy rate ensures that incidents are handled according to their severity, optimising the response effort.

#### **f. What are the key steps involved in the incident response process, and how are they tracked and measured?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of key response steps successfully completed.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Key step completion rate = 
    (Number of successfully completed key steps / Total number of key steps) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher completion rate reflects a well-executed response process.

#### **g. What is the average time it takes to identify the root cause of security incidents, and what measures are in place to ensure a thorough investigation?**
- **Metric**: Average time to identify the root cause of incidents.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average root cause identification time = 
    Total time to identify root causes / Number of incidents
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A shorter time indicates an efficient investigation process, ensuring timely remediation.

#### **h. How are incident response teams trained and prepared for different types of security incidents, and how is their performance assessed during incident response exercises?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of incident response teams meeting performance benchmarks during exercises.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Exercise performance benchmark rate = 
    (Number of teams meeting benchmarks / Total number of teams) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A high benchmark rate indicates well-trained and prepared incident response teams.

#### **i. What is the process for restoring systems and data following a security incident, and how is the effectiveness of this process validated?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of successful system and data restorations.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Restoration success rate = 
    (Number of successful restorations / Total number of restoration attempts) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher success rate indicates an effective restoration process.

#### **j. How are lessons learned from security incidents incorporated into incident response plans and procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of incidents with lessons learned incorporated into response plans.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Lessons learned incorporation rate = 
    (Number of incidents with incorporated lessons / Total number of incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher rate reflects a proactive approach to continuous improvement in incident response.

#### **k. What is the role of external resources, such as incident response vendors and law enforcement agencies, in the incident response process, and how are they coordinated and managed?**
- **Metric**: Average time to coordinate with external resources during an incident.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    External coordination time = 
    Total time for coordination with external resources / Number of incidents involving external resources
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A lower time indicates efficient coordination with external resources, improving overall incident response.

#### **l. How are stakeholders, such as customers and business partners, informed and kept up-to-date during the incident response process?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of incidents where stakeholders were informed within the required timeframe.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Stakeholder communication compliance rate = 
    (Number of incidents with timely stakeholder communication / Total number of incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher compliance rate ensures transparency and maintains trust with stakeholders during incident response.
