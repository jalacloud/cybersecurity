### 04. **Security Incidents**

#### **a. How many security incidents have been detected and resolved in the past month/quarter/year?**
- **Metric**: Number of security incidents detected and resolved.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Total incidents resolved = Count of all detected and resolved incidents over the specified period (month/quarter/year)
    ```
  - **Outcome**: This metric helps track the volume and resolution of incidents, providing insight into the organisationâ€™s incident response capability.

#### **b. How many successful cyberattacks have occurred in the past month/quarter/year?**
- **Metric**: Number of successful cyberattacks.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Successful attack count = Count of all successful cyberattacks over the specified period (month/quarter/year)
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A lower number indicates better preventative measures and overall cybersecurity posture.

#### **c. What types of incidents have occurred, and what was the impact of each incident?**
- **Metric 1**: Classification of incidents by type.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Incident classification count = Count of incidents by type (e.g., malware, phishing, DDoS, etc.)
    ```
- **Metric 2**: Impact assessment for each incident type.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Incident impact measure = Quantitative measure of impact (e.g., financial loss, downtime, data loss) per incident type
    ```
  - **Outcome**: This provides an understanding of the incident landscape and the associated risks.

#### **d. What metrics are used to track incident response and resolution times, and how are these metrics used to improve the incident response process?**
- **Metric**: Average incident response and resolution time.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average response time = 
    Total time to respond and resolve incidents / Number of incidents
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A shorter average time reflects a more efficient and effective incident response process.

#### **e. How is data recovery managed in the event of a security incident, and how are backups tested and validated?**
- **Metric 1**: Data recovery success rate.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Data recovery success rate = 
    (Number of successful recoveries / Total number of recovery attempts) * 100
    ```
- **Metric 2**: Frequency of backup tests and validation.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Backup test frequency = Number of backup tests conducted per month/quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: High success rates and frequent testing ensure data integrity and availability during incidents.

#### **f. What is the root cause analysis of each incident, and what corrective actions were taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of incidents with completed root cause analysis and corrective actions.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    RCA and corrective action rate = 
    (Number of incidents with completed RCA and corrective actions / Total number of incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher rate indicates a proactive approach to incident management and prevention.

#### **g. What is the average downtime experienced during a security incident, and what is the impact on the organisation's operations?**
- **Metric 1**: Average incident downtime.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average downtime = 
    Total downtime from all incidents / Number of incidents
    ```
- **Metric 2**: Operational impact measure.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Impact on operations = Quantitative measure of operational impact (e.g., lost revenue, reduced productivity) per incident
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Lower downtime and minimal operational impact reflect effective incident containment and recovery strategies.

#### **h. What is the average cost associated with a security incident, including costs for incident response, remediation, and reputational damage?**
- **Metric**: Average cost per security incident.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average incident cost = 
    (Total cost of incident response, remediation, and reputational damage / Number of incidents)
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A lower average cost indicates more efficient resource use and incident management.

#### **i. How is user behaviour monitored to identify potential security incidents or insider threats?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of security incidents identified through user behaviour monitoring.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    User behaviour monitoring rate = 
    (Number of incidents identified through monitoring / Total number of incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher percentage suggests effective monitoring of user activity to detect insider threats and prevent incidents.

#### **j. How is threat intelligence gathered and used to proactively detect and prevent security incidents?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of incidents prevented due to proactive threat intelligence.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Threat intelligence effectiveness rate = 
    (Number of incidents prevented through threat intelligence / Total number of incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher rate demonstrates the value of integrating threat intelligence into the organisation's security strategy.

#### **k. What is the process for reporting security incidents to regulatory authorities, customers, and other stakeholders?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of incidents reported within required regulatory timeframes.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Reporting compliance rate = 
    (Number of incidents reported on time / Total number of reportable incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Ensures the organisation meets its legal obligations and maintains transparency with stakeholders.

#### **l. How is the organisation's incident response plan updated and tested to ensure it remains effective and relevant?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of incident response plan updates and tests.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Incident response plan update frequency = Number of updates and tests conducted per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular updates and testing ensure the plan remains current and effective in handling emerging threats.
