### 2. **Unidentified Devices on Internal Networks**

#### **a. What is the inventory of authorized devices on your network, and how is it maintained and kept up-to-date?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of authorized devices with up-to-date inventory records.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Percentage of up-to-date inventory = 
    (Number of authorized devices with up-to-date records / Total number of authorized devices) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher percentage indicates better control over network devices and reduced risk from unauthorized or unidentified devices.

#### **b. How many assets are there in your network?**
- **Metric**: Total number of assets on the network.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Total number of assets = Count of all network assets
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Provides a baseline for assessing network complexity and potential attack surface.

#### **c. How many of those assets store sensitive data?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of assets storing sensitive data.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Percentage of sensitive data assets = 
    (Number of assets storing sensitive data / Total number of assets) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Helps in assessing the concentration of sensitive data within the network and the associated risk.

#### **d. What is the process for responding to unauthorized devices on the network, and how are these devices quarantined and monitored?**
- **Metric**: Average time to detect, quarantine, and monitor unauthorized devices.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average response time = 
    Total time from detection to quarantine / Number of unauthorized devices detected
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Shorter response times indicate more effective processes for managing unauthorized devices.

#### **e. How are IoT devices secured, and what is the process for monitoring and patching their vulnerabilities?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of IoT devices with up-to-date security patches.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Percentage of patched IoT devices = 
    (Number of patched IoT devices / Total number of IoT devices) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher percentage suggests better security management for IoT devices, reducing potential vulnerabilities.

#### **f. How is network segmentation implemented, and how are different types of devices segregated on the network?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of network segments that correctly isolate device types.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Segmentation compliance rate = 
    (Number of compliant segments / Total number of segments) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Higher compliance rates indicate effective network segmentation, reducing cross-segment security risks.

#### **g. How are access controls implemented for devices on your network, and what is the process for granting and revoking access permissions?**
- **Metric 1**: Percentage of devices with appropriate access controls.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Access control compliance rate = 
    (Number of devices with correct access controls / Total number of devices) * 100
    ```
- **Metric 2**: Average time to grant/revoke access permissions.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average access control time = 
    Total time to grant/revoke access / Number of access requests processed
    ```
  - **Outcome**: High compliance rates and shorter processing times reflect strong access control practices.

#### **h. How are devices authenticated and authorized before being allowed to connect to the network?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of devices successfully authenticated and authorized.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Successful authentication percentage = 
    (Number of authenticated and authorized devices / Total number of devices attempting to connect) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A high percentage indicates robust authentication and authorization controls, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

#### **i. What is the policy for employees bringing their own devices (BYOD) to work, and how are these devices managed and secured?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of BYOD devices compliant with security policies.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    BYOD compliance rate = 
    (Number of compliant BYOD devices / Total number of BYOD devices) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Higher compliance rates reduce the risk associated with BYOD policies.

#### **j. What measures are in place to detect and respond to rogue access points or other unauthorized network infrastructure?**
- **Metric**: Average time to detect and neutralize rogue access points.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average detection/neutralization time = 
    Total time to detect and neutralize rogue APs / Number of rogue APs detected
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Faster detection and response times indicate stronger network monitoring and security.

#### **k. What is the process for tracking the lifecycle of devices on your network, including acquisition, deployment, maintenance, and retirement?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of devices tracked across their entire lifecycle.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Lifecycle tracking percentage = 
    (Number of devices with complete lifecycle tracking / Total number of devices) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: High percentages indicate better asset management and reduced risk from unmanaged or forgotten devices.

#### **l. How are third-party devices and services securely integrated into your network, and what is the process for managing their access and permissions?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of third-party devices/services with secure integration.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Secure integration rate = 
    (Number of securely integrated third-party devices/services / Total number of third-party devices/services) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: High secure integration rates reflect strong controls over third-party access and permissions.

#### **m. What is the policy for remote access to your network, and what measures are in place to secure and monitor remote connections?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of remote access sessions compliant with security policies.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Remote access compliance rate = 
    (Number of compliant remote access sessions / Total number of remote access sessions) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Higher compliance rates ensure secure and monitored remote access, reducing the risk of external threats.
