### 13. **Vendor Patching Cadence**

#### **a. How frequently are your third-party vendors' systems scanned for vulnerabilities, and how are these scans conducted?**
- **Metric**: Average frequency of vulnerability scans conducted by third-party vendors.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Scan frequency = Number of scans conducted by vendors per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular scanning by vendors ensures that vulnerabilities are identified and addressed promptly, reducing the risk posed by third-party systems.

#### **b. How many risks have been identified in your third-party vendors' systems, and what is the plan to remediate these risks?**
- **Metric 1**: Total number of risks identified in vendor systems.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Total identified risks = Count of all risks identified in vendor systems
    ```
- **Metric 2**: Percentage of identified risks with a remediation plan.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Remediation planning rate = 
    (Number of risks with remediation plans / Total number of identified risks) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher remediation planning rate indicates that identified risks are being addressed systematically, reducing potential vulnerabilities.

#### **c. How many critical vulnerabilities are yet to be remediated in your vendor's systems?**
- **Metric**: Number of unremediated critical vulnerabilities in vendor systems.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Unremediated critical vulnerabilities = Count of all critical vulnerabilities not yet addressed by vendors
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A lower number of unremediated vulnerabilities reflects a stronger security posture among vendors, reducing the risk to the organisation.

#### **d. What is the process for validating vendors have implemented security patches?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of vendors with validated patch implementations.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Patch validation rate = 
    (Number of vendors with validated patches / Total number of vendors) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher validation rate ensures that vendors are effectively applying patches, minimising security risks from unpatched vulnerabilities.

#### **e. What is the process for terminating vendor relationships in the event of poor security performance or failure to comply with security standards?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of vendors terminated due to poor security performance.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Vendor termination rate = 
    (Number of vendors terminated for security reasons / Total number of vendors) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Tracking this rate helps ensure that vendors who fail to meet security standards are swiftly removed from the supply chain, protecting the organisation from associated risks.

#### **f. How is your organisation monitoring fourth-party vendor risk (the vendors used by your vendors)?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of fourth-party vendors assessed for risk.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Fourth-party risk assessment rate = 
    (Number of fourth-party vendors assessed / Total number of fourth-party vendors) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher assessment rate indicates thorough monitoring of the extended supply chain, reducing potential risks from fourth-party vendors.

#### **g. How is your organisation prioritising patching for third-party vendors based on risk level?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of high-risk vendors prioritised for patching.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    High-risk patch prioritisation rate = 
    (Number of high-risk vendors prioritised for patching / Total number of high-risk vendors) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Effective prioritisation ensures that the most significant vulnerabilities are addressed first, reducing overall risk exposure.

#### **h. What is the process for communicating patching requirements and deadlines to third-party vendors?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of vendors compliant with communicated patching deadlines.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Deadline compliance rate = 
    (Number of vendors meeting patching deadlines / Total number of vendors) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher compliance rate ensures that vendors are adhering to patching requirements, maintaining the organisationâ€™s security posture.

#### **i. How is your organisation tracking compliance with vendor patching requirements and deadlines?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of vendors tracked for patching compliance.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Patching compliance tracking rate = 
    (Number of vendors tracked for compliance / Total number of vendors) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Comprehensive tracking ensures that vendors are held accountable for maintaining their security obligations, reducing the risk of unpatched vulnerabilities.
