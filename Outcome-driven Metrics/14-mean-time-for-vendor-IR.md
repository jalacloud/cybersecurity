### 14. **Mean Time for Vendors Incident Response**

#### **a. How long does it take for a vendor to respond to security incidents and vulnerabilities?**
- **Metric**: Average time for vendors to respond to security incidents.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Average vendor response time = 
    Total time taken for all vendors to respond to incidents / Number of incidents
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A shorter response time indicates that vendors are prompt in addressing security issues, which helps in mitigating risks quickly.

#### **b. What is the average MTTR for your vendor's incident response?**
- **Metric**: Vendor-specific Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR).
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Vendor MTTR = 
    Total resolution time for all vendor-related incidents / Number of vendor-related incidents
    ```
  - **Outcome**: This metric provides insight into the efficiency of vendors in resolving security incidents, which is crucial for maintaining overall security.

#### **c. How is incident response coordination managed between your organisation and your vendors?**
- **Metric**: Average coordination time for incident response between the organisation and vendors.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Coordination time = 
    Total time for coordination efforts with vendors / Number of coordinated incidents
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A lower coordination time reflects efficient communication and collaboration, leading to faster incident resolution.

#### **d. How are security incidents and vulnerabilities communicated to vendors, and how is response progress tracked?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of incidents with tracked communication and progress with vendors.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Communication and tracking rate = 
    (Number of incidents with tracked communication/progress / Total number of incidents) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher rate ensures transparency and accountability in the incident response process, leading to better outcomes.

#### **e. How are vendor response times and incident response performance evaluated and monitored?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of vendor responses evaluated and monitored for performance.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Response evaluation rate = 
    (Number of vendor responses evaluated / Total number of vendor responses) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Regular evaluation helps identify areas for improvement in vendor incident response, ensuring that vendors meet the required standards.

#### **f. How are vendor incident response procedures continually evaluated and improved, and what metrics are used to track this process?**
- **Metric**: Frequency of vendor incident response procedure evaluations.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Evaluation frequency = Number of evaluations conducted per quarter/year
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Frequent evaluations ensure that vendor incident response procedures remain effective and are continuously improved to address emerging threats.

#### **g. How are incident response procedures for third-party vendors integrated into your overall incident response plan, and how are they updated and communicated to relevant personnel?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of third-party incident response procedures integrated and communicated.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    Integration and communication rate = 
    (Number of procedures integrated/communicated / Total number of procedures) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: A higher integration and communication rate ensures that third-party incident responses are aligned with the organisationâ€™s overall incident response strategy, improving coordination and effectiveness.

#### **h. How are incident response responsibilities and expectations outlined in service level agreements (SLAs) with third-party vendors, and how are these SLAs monitored and enforced?**
- **Metric**: Percentage of SLAs with clearly defined incident response expectations.
  - **Formula**: 
    ```markdown
    SLA compliance rate = 
    (Number of SLAs with defined incident response expectations / Total number of SLAs) * 100
    ```
  - **Outcome**: Ensuring that SLAs include clear incident response expectations and monitoring them helps maintain vendor accountability and strengthens the overall incident response process.
