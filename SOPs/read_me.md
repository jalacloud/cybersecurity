## SOP Development for High-Value Cyber Security Activities

This repo is dedicated to developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for key cyber security tasks and initiatives. This repository aims to provide clear, concise, and actionable SOPs that ensure consistency, efficiency, and alignment with industry-leading best practices.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive SOP library that serves as a centralised resource for executing high-value cyber security engangements. These SOPs are designed to increase performance, streamline training, and maintain business continuity by providing detailed guidance on essential processes.

## How to Use
Each SOP in this repository is structured to offer clear, step-by-step instructions, including the responsible parties, and required actions. This ensures that any team member, regardless of experience level, can execute tasks correctly and efficiently. The SOPs are categorised for easy navigation and reference, making it simple to locate the procedures relevant to your specific needs.

Basic Structure:
```
Business Problem / Use Case / Policy [WHY]
    -SOP #1 [WHAT, WHEN]
        - Instruction #1 [HOW]
```
