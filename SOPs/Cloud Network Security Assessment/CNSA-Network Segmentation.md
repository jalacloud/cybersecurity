## Cloud Network Security Assessment

### **Network Segmentation in Cloud Environments**

- [ ] **How is network segmentation implemented within your cloud infrastructure to isolate sensitive data and applications?**  
   *For example, do you utilise Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in AWS or Virtual Networks in Azure to create isolated sections of your cloud environment for different departments or applications?*

- [ ] **What strategies are employed to segment different types of workloads and environments (e.g., development, testing, production) in the cloud?**  
   *Do you use separate VPCs or resource groups for each environment, leveraging cloud services like AWS Organisations or Azure Management Groups to enforce policies across them?*

- [ ] **How do you enforce network segmentation policies across various cloud services and third-party integrations?**  
   *Are you implementing security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) provided by cloud vendors to control inbound and outbound traffic between segments?*

- [ ] **What controls are in place to prevent unauthorised lateral movement within your cloud network segments?**  
   *Do you employ micro-segmentation tools like AWS Security Hub or Azure Firewall to monitor and restrict internal traffic at a granular level?*

- [ ] **How are access controls and permissions managed to ensure appropriate segmentation between different user groups and services?**  
   *Are you using Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies in AWS or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure to limit user permissions to specific network segments?*

- [ ] **What tools or services do you utilise to monitor and manage network segmentation in your cloud environment?**  
   *Do you leverage cloud-native monitoring services like AWS CloudWatch or Azure Monitor to keep an eye on network traffic and segmentation effectiveness?*

- [ ] **How often are network segmentation configurations reviewed and updated to address emerging threats and compliance requirements?**  
   *Is there a regular audit process in place using tools like AWS Config Rules or Azure Policy to ensure configurations meet security standards?*

- [ ] **How do you validate that segmentation is effectively isolating critical assets from potential threats in the cloud?**  
   *Do you conduct regular penetration testing or use services like AWS Inspector or Azure Security Centre to assess vulnerabilities within your network segments?*

- [ ] **What measures are taken to secure communication between segmented networks, including encryption and authentication protocols?**  
   *Are you implementing VPN connections between VPCs or using AWS PrivateLink and Azure Private Link to ensure secure, private communication channels?*

- [ ] **How do you handle segmentation for hybrid environments that integrate on-premises infrastructure with cloud services?**  
    *Do you use AWS Direct Connect or Azure ExpressRoute to establish private connections between your on-premises network and cloud segments, maintaining consistent security policies across both?*

- [ ] **What is your process for implementing micro-segmentation within your cloud environment to enhance security at a granular level?**  
    *Are you utilising services like AWS App Mesh or Azure Virtual WAN to manage micro-segmentation and control traffic between individual services or containers?*

- [ ] **How are third-party vendors and services segmented within your network to minimise security risks?**  
    *Do you create dedicated VPCs or subnets for third-party access, using network ACLs and security groups to limit their access only to necessary resources?*

- [ ] **What policies govern the segmentation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected to your cloud network?**  
    *Are you using services like AWS IoT Core or Azure IoT Hub to manage IoT devices in a separate network segment with strict access controls and monitoring?*

- [ ] **How do you test and validate the effectiveness of your network segmentation strategies in the cloud?**  
    *Do you employ simulation tools or red team exercises to test your segmentation, using services like AWS Fault Injection Simulator to introduce faults and observe system responses?*

- [ ] **What training and guidelines are provided to staff to maintain proper network segmentation practices in cloud operations?**  
    *Do you offer regular training sessions on cloud security best practices, perhaps utilising vendor-provided resources like AWS Training and Certification or Microsoft Learn for Azure?*
