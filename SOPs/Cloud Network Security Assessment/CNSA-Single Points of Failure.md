## Single Points of Failure (Topology and Third-Party Based)

- [ ] **What processes are in place to identify single points of failure within your cloud network topology, and how regularly are these assessments performed?**
  - *For example, do you utilise cloud-native tools like AWS Trusted Advisor or Azure Advisor to continuously scan your infrastructure for potential single points of failure and receive recommendations on remediation?*

- [ ] **How does your cloud network design incorporate redundancy to mitigate risks associated with single points of failure?**
  - *Are you deploying critical resources across multiple Availability Zones or Regions using services like AWS Elastic Load Balancing or Azure Traffic Manager to distribute traffic and ensure high availability?*

- [ ] **Which critical components in your cloud infrastructure lack redundancy, and what plans exist to address these vulnerabilities?**
  - *Have you identified single-instance databases or servers, and are you planning to implement solutions like AWS RDS Multi-AZ deployments or Azure SQL Database with failover groups for redundancy?*

- [ ] **How do you assess and manage the risks of single points of failure arising from reliance on third-party cloud service providers?**
  - *Do you have a multi-cloud strategy, perhaps utilising both AWS and Azure, to avoid dependency on a single provider, and do you use tools like Terraform or Ansible for consistent deployment across platforms?*

- [ ] **What contingency plans are in place if a key third-party cloud vendor experiences an outage or security breach?**
  - *Are you employing backup services or failover mechanisms to another cloud provider or on-premises infrastructure, and do you regularly test these plans using disaster recovery drills?*

- [ ] **How do you ensure high availability and failover capabilities for essential cloud-based services and applications?**
  - *Do you implement auto-scaling groups and use services like AWS Auto Scaling or Azure VM Scale Sets to automatically adjust resource capacity in response to demand?*

- [ ] **What monitoring systems are implemented to promptly detect failures in cloud network components?**
  - *Are you using AWS CloudWatch or Azure Monitor to set up real-time alerts and dashboards that track the health of your services and notify you of any anomalies?*

- [ ] **How frequently do you conduct failover testing to ensure that redundant systems in the cloud function as expected during an outage?**
  - *Do you schedule regular testing using tools like AWS Fault Injection Simulator or Azure Chaos Studio to simulate failures and observe how your systems respond?*

- [ ] **What strategies are employed to distribute network traffic in the cloud to prevent overload on any single network path or service?**
  - *Are you utilising content delivery networks (CDNs) such as Amazon CloudFront or Azure CDN to cache content at edge locations, reducing load on origin servers?*

- [ ] **How is data replicated across different cloud systems or regions to prevent loss in case of a component failure?**
  - *Do you use AWS S3 Cross-Region Replication or Azure Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) to automatically copy data to secondary regions for disaster recovery purposes?*

- [ ] **What measures are taken to prevent configuration errors in the cloud environment that could introduce new single points of failure?**
  - *Are you employing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices using AWS CloudFormation or Azure Resource Manager templates to ensure consistent and repeatable deployments?*

- [ ] **How do you evaluate and select third-party cloud vendors to minimise dependency risks, and what criteria do you use for diversification?**
  - *Do you assess vendors based on their compliance certifications, uptime guarantees, and integration capabilities, possibly using tools like AWS Vendor Insights or third-party risk management platforms?*

- [ ] **What is your policy regarding vendor lock-in with cloud service providers, and how do you mitigate the associated risks?**
  - *Are you designing applications using containerisation technologies like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes, which can be deployed across multiple cloud platforms to reduce dependency on a single provider?*

- [ ] **How does your incident response plan address scenarios involving the failure of critical cloud network components or third-party cloud services?**
  - *Does your plan include automated failover to backup systems using services like AWS Route 53 health checks or Azure Traffic Manager, and do you have predefined runbooks for rapid response?*

- [ ] **What training is provided to IT staff to recognise and respond to potential single points of failure within the cloud network?**
  - *Do you offer continuous education through cloud vendor certifications like AWS Certified Solutions Architect or Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert to keep your team updated on best practices?*
