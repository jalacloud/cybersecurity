## Cloud Incident Response

- [ ] **What is your incident response plan for cloud-based security incidents, and how is it integrated with your overall security strategy?**
  - *Do you have a documented plan that includes cloud-specific scenarios, leveraging services like AWS Security Hub or Azure Security Centre to enhance your response capabilities?*

- [ ] **How do you detect and monitor security incidents within your cloud environment in real-time?**
  - *Are you utilising tools like AWS GuardDuty or Azure Sentinel for continuous threat detection and automated alerting?*

- [ ] **What processes are in place for the timely notification and escalation of cloud security incidents?**
  - *Do you have automated notifications set up via AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) or Azure Monitor Alerts to inform key personnel immediately upon incident detection?*

- [ ] **How do you coordinate incident response efforts between your organisation and cloud service providers?**
  - *Have you established clear communication protocols with providers like AWS or Azure, possibly using AWS Support or Azure Support plans for expedited assistance?*

- [ ] **What tools and technologies are used to investigate and remediate cloud security incidents?**
  - *Do you employ AWS CloudTrail or Azure Activity Logs for auditing and forensics, and use automation tools like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions for swift remediation?*

- [ ] **How do you ensure that incident response procedures comply with relevant regulations and industry standards in the cloud context?**
  - *Are you aligning your processes with frameworks like ISO 27001 or GDPR, utilising compliance services like AWS Artifact or Azure Compliance Manager?*

- [ ] **What training and drills are conducted to prepare your team for responding to cloud-based incidents?**
  - *Do you perform regular simulation exercises using tools like AWS Fault Injection Simulator or Azure Chaos Studio to test your team's readiness?*

- [ ] **How is incident response documentation maintained and updated to reflect changes in the cloud environment?**
  - *Are you using version control systems like GitHub or AWS CodeCommit to manage documentation, ensuring it stays current with infrastructure changes?*

- [ ] **What measures are taken to preserve evidence and maintain forensic integrity during a cloud security incident?**
  - *Do you follow best practices by creating snapshots or backups using AWS Backup or Azure Backup, and securing logs in immutable storage like AWS S3 with Object Lock or Azure Immutable Blob Storage?*

- [ ] **How do you handle communication with customers and stakeholders during and after a cloud security incident?**
  - *Is there a communication plan that includes guidelines and templates, perhaps utilising AWS SNS or Azure Communication Services to disseminate information efficiently?*

- [ ] **What is your process for post-incident analysis and learning to prevent future cloud security incidents?**
  - *Do you conduct thorough root cause analyses and document lessons learned, using collaboration tools integrated with your cloud services like AWS WorkDocs or Microsoft Teams?*

- [ ] **How are third-party vendors involved in your cloud incident response plan, and what are their responsibilities?**
  - *Have you defined their roles in your incident response plan and included them in drills, ensuring they comply with your security policies and procedures?*

- [ ] **What is your strategy for maintaining business continuity during a cloud security incident?**
  - *Do you employ multi-region deployments and services like AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery or Azure Site Recovery to minimise downtime?*

- [ ] **How do you ensure that incident response tools and scripts are secure and up-to-date in your cloud environment?**
  - *Are you managing them with services like AWS Systems Manager or Azure Automation, enforcing code reviews and regular updates?*

- [ ] **What measures are in place to prevent recurrence of similar cloud security incidents?**
  - *Do you implement changes based on findings, such as updating security groups in AWS or network security groups in Azure, and enforce policies with AWS Config Rules or Azure Policy?*
